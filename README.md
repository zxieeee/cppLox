# Hey cpplox here

cpplox is an implementation of jlox (from crafting interpreters book). I have implemented the first part of book from chapter 4 (scanning) in cpp. cpplox is going to be an interpreted C style language with dynamically typed datatypes.

I hope this will serve as a good learning project for me and the those who come after me.
